  by Zack Sanborn, Stephen Benz.

Usage:
  pyra [command]

Commands:
  create job.list  : create a batch of jobs from file
  clean            : cleans up tmp files
  push             : push jobs
  time             : check time / status of running jobs
  stop             : kill all running jobs and stop pyrasol
  maxjob INT       : set max jobs
  maxjobtime INT   : set max job time in seconds
  notification TYPE: enable/disable notification (options: prowl,email)
  crashed          : list crashed jobs
  inspect batch.gz : compute summary of batch

Requirements:
  1) Python 2.4.3 and above
  2) A need for speed!

Installation:
  1) Put directory containing pyrasol in your PATH. 
  2) Set pyra.py and pyrasol.py to be executable, if not already. 

Example:
  See README in pyrasol/example directory for instructions on how to run example batch. The example provides
  an example batch list and a test program (testpyra.py) to simulate using pyrasol to run a batch of 
  crash-prone jobs with varying run times.

Credits:
Pyrasol is inspired by parasol, a batch system developed by Jim Kent & the UCSC Genome Browser group.
